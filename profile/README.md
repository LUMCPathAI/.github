# **Leiden University Medical Center: PathAI Organization**

## **Mission**
The **PathAI organization** aims to foster collaboration and streamline code-sharing across all digital pathology projects conducted at the **Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC)**. Our overarching goal is to **standardize digital pathology workflows**, from **quality control (QC) and slide processing** to downstream tasks like **multiple instance learning (MIL), segmentation, and graph neural networks (GNNs)**. 

Standardization enhances **efficiency, reduces errors, and accelerates research** by ensuring reproducibility and resource optimization. Access to the organization is restricted to **LUMC researchers**, who can be invited by one of the moderators. However, select repositories, such as **[PathBench-MIL](https://github.com/Sbrussee/PathBench-MIL)**, will be publicly available.
